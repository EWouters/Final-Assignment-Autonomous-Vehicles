The main results are that while both GDP and population have significant effects on sales of new cars, substantial deviations between projected and actual sales still remain. The countries that exceeded the projected sales include Iran, Russia, Brazil, Malaysia, Romania, India, Pakistan, Venezuela, and South Africa. In other words, for these countries, reliance only on GDP and population size underestimates the actual sales. Using the relationship that was derived from the 2006 data, projected future GDPs and populations, and assuming that the deviations from the 2006 model are systematic and will remain proportionally constant in the medium term, illustrative calculations were then made for sales of new cars in 2014 and 2020. According to these calculations, the countries with the greatest absolute increases in projected sales from 2006 to both 2014 and 2020 are likely to be China, India, Russia, Brazil, Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the key factors influencing the adoption of driverless cars. Drawing on quantitative evidence, the study found that the ability of the driverless car to meet performance expectations and its reliability were important adoption determinants. Significant concerns included privacy (autonomy, location tracking and surveillance) and security (from hackers). The paper provides implications for firms developing the next generation of car features and early implementation sites."

  abstract = {
Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a new intersection control protocol that exploits the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to control traffic at intersections in a way better than traffic signals and stop signs.  A key assumption of this protocol is that vehicles can always follow their trajectories.  But mechanical failures can occur in real life, causing vehicles to deviate from their trajectories. A previous approach for handling mechanical failure was to prevent vehicles from entering the intersection after the failure.  However, this approach cannot prevent collisions among vehicles already in the intersection or too close to stop because (1) the lack of coordination  among vehicles can cause collisions during the execution of evasive actions; and (2) the intersection may not have enough room for evasive actions.  In this paper, we propose a preemptive approach that pre-computes evasion plans for several common types of mechanical failures before vehicles enter an intersection.  This preemptive approach is necessary because there are situations in which vehicles cannot evade without pre-allocation of space for evasion.  We present a modified AIM protocol and demonstrate the effectiveness of evasion plan execution on a miniature autonomous intersection testbed.},

abstract = "This study seeks to develop a cooperative platoon control for a platoon mixed with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-drive vehicles (HDVs), aiming to ensure system level traffic flow smoothness and stability as well as individual vehicles’ mobility and safety. Specifically, our study integrated/contributed the following technical approaches. First, the car-following behavior of human-drive vehicles is modeled by well-accepted Newell car-following models. Accordingly, an online curve matching algorithm is integrated to anticipate the aggregated response delay of the human-drive vehicles using real-time trajectory data. Built upon that, constrained One- or P-step MPC models are developed to control the movement of the CAV platoon upstream or downstream of the HDV platoon so that we can ensure both transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic stability of this sample mixed flow platoon, leveraging the communication and computation technologies equipped on CAVs. Considering the lack of the centralized computation facilities and severe changes of the platoon topology, this study develops a distributed algorithm to solve the MPCs according to the properties of the optimizers, such as solution uniqueness, sequentially feasibility, and nonempty interior point of the solution space. The convergence of the distributed algorithm as well as the stability of the MPC control is proved by both the theoretical analysis and the experimental study. Extensive numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the distributed algorithm can solve the One-step and P-step MPCs efficiently. The cooperative MPC can dampen traffic oscillation propagation and stabilize the traffic flow more efficiently for the entire mixed flow platoon. Moreover, the cooperative platoon control scheme outperforms the other three control strategies, including the non-cooperative control strategy and a latest CACC strategy in literature."

abstract = "To guarantee the road safety by avoiding collisions at the intersections is one of the major tasks of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which contributes to the minimal fatalities and property loss in crashes. This paper proposes an effective algorithm for infrastructure-cooperative intersection accident pre-warning system with the aid of vehicular communications. The proposed algorithm realizes accurate and efficient collision avoidances through five steps, i.e., defining variable, reasoning the vehicles evolution state, verifying safe driving behavior, assessing risk, and making decision. The critical factors are theoretically analyzed, and a vehicle state evolution model based on the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is established. The efficient risk assessment method based on identifying the dangerous driving behavior at intersection and different collision avoidance strategies are proposed according to the actual situation. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out to verify the performance of the proposal, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect risk and accurately migrate the collision."

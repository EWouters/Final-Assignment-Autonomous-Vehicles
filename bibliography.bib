abstract = {In this study we first modeled the effects of GDP and population size on sales of new cars in 2006 for the following 25 developing countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, China, Chile, Columbia, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Vietnam. The main results are that while both GDP and population have significant effects on sales of new cars, substantial deviations between projected and actual sales still remain. The countries that exceeded the projected sales include Iran, Russia, Brazil, Malaysia, Romania, India, Pakistan, Venezuela, and South Africa. In other words, for these countries, reliance only on GDP and population size underestimates the actual sales. Using the relationship that was derived from the 2006 data, projected future GDPs and populations, and assuming that the deviations from the 2006 model are systematic and will remain proportionally constant in the medium term, illustrative calculations were then made for sales of new cars in 2014 and 2020. According to these calculations, the countries with the greatest absolute increases in projected sales from 2006 to both 2014 and 2020 are likely to be China, India, Russia, Brazil, Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey.},

abstract = "Driverless cars are seen as one of the key disruptors in the next technology revolution. However, the main barrier to adoption is the lack of public trust. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key factors influencing the adoption of driverless cars. Drawing on quantitative evidence, the study found that the ability of the driverless car to meet performance expectations and its reliability were important adoption determinants. Significant concerns included privacy (autonomy, location tracking and surveillance) and security (from hackers). The paper provides implications for firms developing the next generation of car features and early implementation sites."
